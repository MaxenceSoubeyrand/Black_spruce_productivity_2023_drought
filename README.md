# Simulated impacts of the 2023 megadrought on black spruce potential productivity across Canada

This repository contains the R code and the results data to retrieve the graphs from the "DOI of the article when available" study. We aimed to determine the impacts of the 2023 mega-drought on black spruce productivity in Canada. The aim was also to determine trends in productivity from 1950 to 2024 in Canada.
