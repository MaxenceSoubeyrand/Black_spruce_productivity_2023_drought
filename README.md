# Simulated impacts of the 2023 megadrought on black spruce productivity across Canada

This repository contains the R code and the results data to retrieve the graphs from the "DOI of the article when available" study. We aimed to determine if future climate and competition are factors that prevent the colonization of temperate species, i.e., sugar maple, red maple, and yellow birch, from becoming established just above their continuous northern limit of distribution.
